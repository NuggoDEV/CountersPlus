# CountersPlus
A combination of widely-used counters, all configurable in one Beat Saber mod.

## What is this?
**Counters+** (also known as CountersPlus) is a powerful UI Enhancement mod for the popular VR rhythm game Beat Saber. It features a variety of different counters that track varying statistics, all bundled into one core system.

Counters+ also boasts a large amount of configuration, all available from a custom made settings menu.

## Installation
To install Counters+, simply use a Beat Saber mod manager such as [ModAssistant](https://github.com/Assistant/ModAssistant). This will ensure that any dependencies are installed along with Counters+. If you like to do things manually, download Counters+ from [BeatMods](https://beatmods.com), and drag and drop the containing `Plugins` folder into your Beat Saber directory.

If you want to get access to any potential Hotfix or Prelease/Beta builds Counters+ has to offer, simply watch the repository, and grab the latest release in the [Releases page](https://github.com/Caeden117/CountersPlus/releases).
